        <p>Dive into the realm of creativity with our Derivative Tool, exclusively crafted for the holders of FTLS NFTs. This unique tool is designed to provide you with a novel way to interact with your NFTs, offering you the autonomy to deconstruct and reassemble your digital assets in imaginative ways.</p>
        
        <h2>What is the Derivative Tool?</h2>
        <p>The Derivative Tool is an exclusive feature available to our NFT holders, enabling them to download a comprehensive package of their NFT components. This tool not only allows you to view your NFT in its entirety but also to access and manipulate individual elements that make up the NFT. It's a bridge between ownership and creativity, offering you a canvas to remix, reconfigure, and reinvent your digital assets.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Connect Your Wallet:</strong> Initiate the process by connecting your digital wallet. This connection is essential for the tool to access and display the NFTs you own from our collection.</li>
            <li><strong>View Your NFTs:</strong> Post connection, your NFTs will be showcased. Select any NFT to delve deeper into its composition.</li>
            <li><strong>Download and Explore:</strong> Clicking on an NFT triggers the download of a package containing the full NFT image and separate transparent PNG files for each constituent element. This package is your toolkit for creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Create Anew:</strong> Once downloaded, extract the files and start your creative journey. Each element can be used independently or in conjunction with elements from other NFTs, providing a vast array of artistic possibilities.</li>
        </ul>
